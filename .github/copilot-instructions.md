### Content Guidelines

- **Financial Data**: Use South African Rand (ZAR/R) for all monetary values
- **Measurements**: Use metric system (meters, kilograms, liters, Celsius)
- **Dates**: Use format "Month Year" or "DD MMM YYYY" for consistency
- **Location References**: Always specify "Bela Bela, Limpopo Province, South Africa"

### Technical Specifications

- Include specific measurements and quantities
- Provide actionable implementation details
- Reference local conditions (climate, soil, regulations)
- Include safety protocols and compliance information

## Agricultural Context

### Key Crops (Diversified Farm Management)

1. **Dragon Fruit** - Wall-farming initiative with detailed technical specifications
2. **Moringa** - Leaf harvest and production management
3. **Lucerne** - High-value forage crop cultivation
4. **Additional Crops** - System designed to accommodate various crop types

### Farm Management Features

- Multi-crop planning and tracking
- Financial projections and ROI analysis per crop
- Operations scheduling and task management

### Local Context

- Small-scale diversified farming operation
- Focus on sustainable practices
- Water efficiency optimization
- Organic growing methods preference
- Scalable to multiple farm sizes and crop combinations

## Application Development Guidelines

### Next.js Best Practices

- Use Server Components by default, Client Components when needed
- Implement proper data fetching patterns (server-side when possible)
- Optimize for performance (image optimization, lazy loading, code splitting)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)

### Database and Data Management

- Design schema to support multiple crop types and farm operations
- Implement proper data validation and sanitization
- Use efficient queries and caching strategies
- Support offline functionality where appropriate
- Enable data export/import for backup and migration

### UI/UX Principles

- Clean, intuitive interface for farm managers
- Dashboard with key metrics and quick actions
- Mobile-responsive design for field use
- Data visualization for financial and operational insights
- Support for South African locale (currency, date formats, language)

## Making Changes

### When Adding Documentation Content

- Ensure new content aligns with existing business plan structure
- Maintain consistency in financial calculations and projections
- Cross-reference related sections appropriately
