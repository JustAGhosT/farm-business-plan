# Fertility & Nutrient Management Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide provides a science-based approach to fertility management, emphasizing soil test-based decisions, crop-specific nutrient removal rates, and precision agriculture principles. The framework replaces blanket annual applications with targeted, efficient strategies that reduce costs while maintaining or improving yields and quality.

## Core Principles

### 1. Base Rates on Soil Tests + Removal, Not Blanket Annual P/K

**Sufficiency Strategy:**

- Apply P and K only when soil tests indicate a likely yield response
- Replace blanket "30-40 P + 100-150 K every year" approach
- Move to maintenance band: apply removal rates once tests show sufficiency
- Avoid overbuilding P/K on many soils (wastes money)

### 2. Account for Residue Cycling

For crops like sunflower and sorghum, residue cycling returns a meaningful portion of K:

- Don't pay twice for the same nutrients
- Account for K returned via crop residues in your fertility plan
- Adjust applied K rates based on residue management

### 3. Simple Removal Math (While Waiting for Soil Tests)

Use these ballpark figures per unit yield:

| Crop              | P₂O₅ Removal | K₂O Removal     | Example Calculation                  |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Soybean**       | 0.75 lb/bu   | 1.17 lb/bu      | 50 bu/ac = 37.5 lb P₂O₅, 58.5 lb K₂O |
| **Grain Sorghum** | 0.42 lb/bu   | 0.21-0.25 lb/bu | 100 bu/ac = 42 lb P₂O₅, 23 lb K₂O    |
| **Potato**        | 3 lb/ton     | 12.5 lb/ton     | 20 ton/ac = 60 lb P₂O₅, 250 lb K₂O   |
| **Beetroot**      | 2.5 lb/ton   | 10 lb/ton       | 20 ton/ac = 50 lb P₂O₅, 200 lb K₂O   |
| **Sunflower**     | 1.2 lb/cwt   | 0.8 lb/cwt      | 30 cwt/ac = 36 lb P₂O₅, 24 lb K₂O\*  |

\*Note: Sunflower residues return significant K - reduce applied K accordingly

## Nitrogen Programs by Crop Transition

### Soybean → Potato

**Soybean N Credit:**

- Conservative estimate: 30-45 lb N/ac (default 37.5 lb/ac)
- Use local data if available for more precise credits

**Potato N Management:**

- **Split application:** Preplant/at-plant + early sidedress/fertigation
- **Base rates:** Typical 100-150 lb N/ac depending on soil test
- **Monitoring:** Petiole nitrate testing during bulking
  - Target range: 13,000-15,000 ppm NO₃-N
  - Frequency: Weekly from tuber initiation through bulking
- **Sulfur:** Add 15-30 lb S/ac (sulfate form), especially on sands/irrigated ground

**Sources:** cropwatch.unl.edu, University of Minnesota Extension

### Potato → Sorghum

**Residual K Management:**

- Expect low residual K on sandy soils
- Check 0-6" K levels
- Consider in-season K if tests are low

**Nitrogen Strategy:**

- Sorghum uses leftover soil N efficiently
- Sample nitrate to 24" depth to set N rates
- Credit residual N from potato fertilization
- Reduce applied N rates accordingly

**Source:** eUpdate

### Sorghum → Beetroot

**N Immobilization Management:**

- Sorghum residues tie up N temporarily
- Counter with 20-40 lb N/ac early (starter or shortly after emergence)
- Exception: If cover was terminated young, immobilization is minimal

**Soil pH Management:**

- Target pH: 6.2-7.0
- Purpose: Maximize micronutrient availability
- Test before planting and adjust if needed

**Boron Requirements:**

- **Preplant:** 2-3 lb B/ac broadcast uniformly
- **Midseason:** Small foliar application if soil marginal and symptoms appear
- **Warning:** Narrow safety margin - do not exceed label rates
- **Symptoms:** Heart rot, black spot indicate B deficiency

**Sources:** eUpdate, New England Vegetable Management Guide

### Beetroot → Sunflower

**Nutritional Compatibility:**

- This transition is nutritionally sound
- No special N adjustments needed

**P/K Placement:**

- Band P/K 2x2 from seed row
- **Critical:** Keep all salt away from seed
- Sunflower is highly sensitive to salt near seed

**Nitrogen Management:**

- Sample soil profile nitrate to 24" depth
- Sunflower can tap even deeper (4-6 ft) where testing is practical
- Follow local price/yield-based N tables
- Credit all profile nitrate

**Sources:** Manitoba Crop Alliance, University of Minnesota Extension

### Sunflower → Soybean (or Cereal Buffer)

**White Mold Management:**

- **Critical:** Insert sorghum/cereal if white-mold episodes have occurred
- **Minimum:** 3-year non-host break between sunflower and soybean
- **Alternative:** Combine varietal tolerance + canopy management + row width adjustments

**Allelopathy Mitigation:**

- Plant small-grain (oat/rye) buffer to dilute allelopathic effects
- Helps prepare soil for soybean establishment

## Potassium Source & Timing

### For Potatoes (Critical for Quality)

**Preferred Source: K₂SO₄ (Sulfate of Potash - SOP)**

- Better for specific gravity
- Improves fry color
- Includes sulfur benefit

**Avoid:**

- Heavy preplant KCl applications
- KCl near tuber bulking period

**If Using KCl for Economics:**

- Apply well ahead of tuber bulking
- Keep away from root zone
- Consider split applications

**Source:** University of Minnesota Extension

### For Other Crops

| Source                  | Characteristics          | Best Use                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| KCl (Muriate of Potash) | Economical, 60% K₂O      | General field crops where quality not affected   |
| K₂SO₄ (SOP)             | Premium, 50% K₂O + 18% S | Quality crops (potato, vegetables, fruits)       |
| Timing                  | -                        | Keep heavy K away from sensitive crop root zones |

## Boron Management Nuances

### Beetroot (High Priority)

**Application:**

- Rate: 2-3 lb B/ac preplant
- Method: Broadcast uniformly on low-B sands
- **Warning:** Narrow safety margin - do not exceed label rates

**Monitoring:**

- Visual symptoms: Heart rot, black spot
- Tissue testing for confirmation
- Foliar application only if deficiency confirmed

**Source:** New England Vegetable Management Guide

### Sunflower (Test First - Don't Assume)

**Local Response Variability:**

- Globally susceptible to B deficiency
- However, many northern Great Plains studies show **no yield response** even on low-B soils
- Local responses vary significantly

**Recommendation:**

- **Test first** - soil and tissue
- Don't blanket-apply where data show "no response"
- Apply only with documented local response or confirmed deficiency
