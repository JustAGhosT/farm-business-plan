## 4.8 Fertility Management and Soil Monitoring

### Soil Sampling Schedule

**Annual Soil Testing (Every Crop Year):**

| Test Type | Depth | Parameters | Timing | Action |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| Standard Profile | 0-6" | pH, P, K, Zn, OM, CEC | Before planting season | Adjust fertility plan |
| Nitrate Profile | 0-24" | Nitrate-N, Sulfate-S | Before planting season | Set N rates |
| Deep Sampling | 2-4 ft | Nitrate-N | Before deep-rooted crops (sunflower) | Quantify deep N reserves |

**Sampling Method:**
- [ ] Use zone or grid sampling pattern
- [ ] Maintain consistent sampling locations year-to-year
- [ ] Send to certified lab within 24 hours
- [ ] Record GPS coordinates of sample points
- [ ] File results systematically by field and date

### In-Season Tissue Testing Schedule

**Crop-Specific Monitoring:**

#### Potato

- **Sample Type:** Petiole NOâ
- **Frequency:** Weekly from tuber initiation through bulking
- **Target Range:** 13,000-15,000 ppm NOâ-N
- **Action:** Adjust fertigation to maintain range
- **Record:** Date, growth stage, reading, action taken

#### Beetroot

- **Sample Type:** Leaf tissue + visual inspection
- **Monitor For:** Boron deficiency symptoms
- **Symptoms:** Heart rot, black spot, internal browning
- **Action:** Foliar B application only if deficiency confirmed
- **Rate:** Follow label, typically 0.5-1 lb B/ac foliar

#### Sunflower

- **Sample Type:** Visual scouting + tissue if symptoms appear
- **Monitor For:** B and Zn deficiency symptoms
- **Action:** Apply only with documented deficiency
- **Note:** Test first - don't assume response

### Nutrient Application Records

**Required Documentation:**

| Date | Field/Block | Crop | Product | Rate | Method | Cost | Operator | Conditions |
|------|------------|------|---------|------|--------|------|----------|------------|
| [Date] | [ID] | [Crop] | [Fertilizer type] | [lbs/ac] | [Broadcast/Band/Foliar] | [R] | [Name] | [Weather/soil] |

**Application Checklist:**
- [ ] Soil test results reviewed and plan created
- [ ] Products ordered and received
- [ ] Calibrate equipment before application
- [ ] Check weather forecast (no rain for foliar, etc.)
- [ ] Verify correct product and rate
- [ ] Document application immediately after completion
- [ ] Monitor crop response 7-14 days post-application
- [ ] File records for future reference and compliance

### Sufficiency-Based P/K Strategy

**Decision Framework:**

1. **Review Soil Test Results:**
   - [ ] Compare P and K levels to critical thresholds
   - [ ] Identify fields in maintenance vs. build-up ranges

2. **Calculate Removal Rates:**
   - [ ] Use crop-specific removal rates from Fertility Management Guide
   - [ ] Multiply by expected yield to get removal amounts

3. **Determine Application Rates:**
   - **Low Tests (Build-up):** Apply removal rate + build-up (follow soil test recommendations)
   - **Maintenance Range:** Apply removal rate only
   - **High Tests:** Reduce or skip P/K, monitor yield response

4. **Placement Strategy:**
   - [ ] Band P/K 2x2 from seed for salt-sensitive crops
   - [ ] Broadcast for uniform-feeding crops
   - [ ] Keep salt away from seed (sunflower, etc.)

### Nitrogen Management by Crop Transition

**Credit Previous Crop N:**

| Previous Crop | N Credit (lb/ac) | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Legumes (soybean, clover) | 30-45 | Conservative estimate |
| Potato | Variable | Sample residual nitrate 0-24" |
| Sorghum | Minimal to negative | May immobilize N, add 20-40 lb N/ac early for following crop |
| Cover crops (young) | 30-60 | Depends on biomass and termination timing |
| Cover crops (mature) | -20 to 0 | May tie up N temporarily |

**Profile Nitrate Sampling:**
- [ ] Sample to 24" depth before planting
- [ ] Credit all nitrate-N in calculation
- [ ] Adjust applied N rate accordingly
- [ ] Sample deeper (4-6 ft) for deep-rooted crops if practical

### Potassium Source Selection

**Crop-Specific Recommendations:**

| Crop | Preferred Source | Reason | Avoid |
|------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Potato | KâSOâ (SOP) | Maintains quality (SG, fry color) + adds S | Heavy preplant KCl |
| Beetroot | KâSOâ or KCl | Either acceptable, watch timing | Heavy salt near young plants |
| Sunflower | KCl acceptable | Economical, but band 2x2 | Salt near seed |
| General | KCl | Most economical | N/A |

**If Using KCl for Economics:**
- [ ] Apply well ahead of critical growth periods
- [ ] Keep away from sensitive root zones
- [ ] Split applications to reduce salt concentration

### Micronutrient Management

**Boron Applications:**

| Crop | Rate (lb B/ac) | Method | Timing | Warning |
|------|----------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Beetroot | 2-3 | Broadcast preplant | Before planting | Narrow safety margin |
| Beetroot (rescue) | 0.5-1 | Foliar | If symptoms appear | Follow label strictly |
| Sunflower | Test first | Only if documented need | Based on local data | Don't assume response |

**Sulfur Applications:**

| Crop | Rate (lb S/ac) | Source | Conditions |
|------|----------------|--------|------------|
| Potato | 15-30 | Sulfate form | Sandy/irrigated soils |
| Sunflower | 15-30 | Sulfate or SOP | Sandy/irrigated soils |
| General | 10-20 | Sulfate | When soil S < 10 ppm |

### pH Management

**Target Ranges by Crop:**

| Crop | Optimal pH | Critical Reason |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Beetroot | 6.2-7.0 | Maximize micronutrient availability, prevent B deficiency |
| Potato | 5.5-6.5 | Reduce scab risk while maintaining nutrient availability |
| Legumes | 6.0-7.0 | Optimize nodulation and N fixation |
| General | 6.0-7.0 | Good nutrient availability |

**pH Adjustment:**
- [ ] Test pH annually in every field
- [ ] Apply lime 3-6 months before planting if pH < target
- [ ] Apply sulfur if pH > 7.5 (rare for most areas)
- [ ] Retest after adjustment to confirm correction

### Cover Crop Integration

**Cover Crop Selection by Rotation Window:**

| After Crop | Recommended Cover | Timing | Benefits | Termination |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Potato | Rye | Immediate post-harvest | Catch leachable N, protect structure | Spring, 2-3 weeks before planting |
| Potato | Rye + Crimson Clover | Immediate post-harvest | N fixation for spring credit | Spring, 2-3 weeks before planting |
| Sunflower | Oat/Rye buffer | Post-harvest | Dilute allelopathy | Before soybean planting |
| General | Sorghum-sudangrass | Summer fallow | Biomass, break compaction | Early, 30+ days before high-N crop |

**Cover Crop Management Checklist:**
- [ ] Select appropriate species for rotation window
- [ ] Plant at recommended rates and timing
- [ ] Monitor establishment and growth
- [ ] Terminate at proper timing (critical for N management)
- [ ] Allow decomposition time before planting cash crop
- [ ] Document biomass and condition at termination

### Disease Management Through Fertility

**White Mold Prevention (Sunflower/Soybean):**
- [ ] Enforce 3-year break between sunflower and soybean
- [ ] Insert cereal buffer crop if needed
- [ ] Use resistant varieties when available
- [ ] Manage canopy density (row spacing, population)
- [ ] Document white mold occurrence by field

### Monthly Fertility Management Checklist
