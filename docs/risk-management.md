## 6.1 Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Rating System

**Use this system to evaluate all identified risks:**

| Risk Level | Impact Score | Probability Score | Priority | Action Required                      |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Critical   | 5            | 0.8-1.0           | Urgent   | Immediate action, daily monitoring   |
| High       | 4            | 0.6-0.7           | High     | Urgent attention, weekly monitoring  |
| Medium     | 3            | 0.4-0.5           | Medium   | Planned response, monthly monitoring |
| Low        | 2            | 0.2-0.3           | Low      | Monitor, quarterly review            |
| Negligible | 1            | 0.0-0.1           | Minimal  | Note and watch for changes           |

**Risk Score Calculation:**

```
Risk Score = Impact Ã— Probability
```

**Impact Scoring Guide:**

- **5 (Catastrophic)**: Could cause business failure or total crop loss
- **4 (Major)**: Significant financial loss or production disruption (>50%)
- **3 (Moderate)**: Noticeable impact but manageable (25-50% loss)
- **2 (Minor)**: Small impact, easily recovered (<25% loss)
- **1 (Minimal)**: Negligible effect on operations

**Probability Scoring Guide:**

- **0.9-1.0**: Almost certain (>90% chance)
- **0.7-0.8**: Likely (70-90% chance)
- **0.5-0.6**: Possible (50-70% chance)
- **0.3-0.4**: Unlikely (30-50% chance)
- **0.1-0.2**: Rare (10-30% chance)
- **<0.1**: Very rare (<10% chance)

### Comprehensive Risk Inventory

**Create a master list of all identified risks:**

| Risk ID | Category      | Risk Description | Impact | Probability | Risk Score | Priority |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| E-01    | Environmental | [Specific risk]  | [1-5]  | [0-1]       | [Score]    | [Level]  |

| O-01    | Operational   | [Specific risk]  | [1-5]  | [0-1]       | [Score]    | [Level]  |
| M-01    | Market        | [Specific risk]  | [1-5]  | [0-1]       | [Score]    | [Level]  |
| F-01    | Financial     | [Specific risk]  | [1-5]  | [0-1]       | [Score]    | [Level]  |
