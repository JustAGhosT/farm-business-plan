## 1. Climate, Soil and Land Considerations

### 1.1 Location and Weather

Bela Bela experiences:
- **Hot summers**: Often 30–33°C
- **Mild, dry winters**: Almost rain-free
- **Annual rainfall**: Modest ~450–600 mm, falling mostly between October and March
- **Frost**: Rare but can occur; planting should begin after the last frost in September
- **Irrigation**: Required in the dry season due to winter water scarcity

**Land topology**: A slight slope or ridge helps avoid frost pockets and water-logging.

### 1.2 Soil Requirements

**Moringa and Dragonfruit**:
- Prefer well-drained sandy or loamy soil
- pH: 6–7.5
- Avoid heavy clay or waterlogged spots
- Incorporate compost or manure before planting
- Add lime if soil is very acidic

**Lucerne**:
- Does best on deep, fertile, neutral loams
- Needs a flat area for mechanical cutting

### 1.3 Land Area

- **Minimum viable plot**: Quarter-hectare (≈2,500 m²) for moringa
- **Plan envisages**: 0.25–1 ha total
- **Lucerne**: Requires bigger blocks to justify hay-making effort
- **Dragonfruit**: Can be profitable on small areas but needs trellis for each plant

## 2. Moringa (Moringa oleifera)

### 2.1 Overview

Moringa is a fast-growing tree valued for its nutrient-rich leaves, pods (drumsticks), and seeds. In a warm climate with occasional irrigation, it can deliver its first leaf harvest within 6–8 months.

### 2.2 Cultivation

#### Land Preparation
- Remove weeds
- Lightly plough the soil
- Work in compost or manure during winter or early spring (June–August)
- Raised beds or ridges improve drainage on heavier soils

#### Planting
- **Method**: Sow seeds directly or start seedlings in nursery bags and transplant when 20–30 cm tall
- **Timing**: Plant just after the last frost (September–October) to benefit from the rainy season
- **Spacing**:
  - For leaf production: 1 × 1 m (up to 10,000 trees/ha in intensive systems)
  - For pods and seed: 3 × 3 m or wider
  - Moderate density: ≈2,500–3,000 trees/ha allows both leaves and pods

#### Water Management
- Water every 2–3 days for the first three months
- Once established, moringa is drought-tolerant thanks to its deep tap-root
- Yields improve with irrigation during dry winter
- Target: 20–30 L per tree per week when rain is absent
- Mulch around trees to retain moisture

#### Pruning and Care
- When trees reach 60–90 cm high, pinch the growing tip to encourage multiple branches
- Keep plants bushy and within 2–3 m height
- Weed regularly
- Thin out extra seedlings
- Protect young plants from goats or rabbits
- Use organic sprays (e.g., neem oil) for aphids or caterpillars

#### Harvesting
- **First leaves**: Ready after 6–8 months
- Cut young shoots 50 cm above ground to harvest and dry leaves for powder or tea
- Tree regrows quickly
- **Frequency**: Two to three leaf harvests per year with irrigation
- **Pod production**: Begins in second year (hundreds of pods per mature tree)
- **Peak production**: Year 3
- Seeds can be pressed for oil or sold for planting

- Gross income: ~R150,000
- Net profit: >R140,000 on 0.25 ha

*These estimates assume all processed leaves are sold at mid-range prices. Direct retail or value-added products (capsules, teas) could boost returns, while bulk sales to processors would reduce the price.*

### 2.5 Frost Protection and Offset Areas

Moringa is sensitive to frost, especially when young. To mitigate risk:

1. Delay planting until after the last frost (late September)
2. Select higher, better-drained positions rather than hollows where cold air pools
3. Wrap young trees with hessian, frost cloth, or plastic on cold nights
4. If frost burns the top, cut the tree back to ground level in spring—it often resprouts from the base
5. Consider planting a windbreak or intercropping with taller species (e.g., maize or sunhemp) on the windward side to deflect cold gusts

If frost becomes a recurring problem, relocating the moringa operation to warmer lowland areas of Limpopo, Mpumalanga, or KwaZulu-Natal may be necessary. These regions have milder winters and are already home to many successful moringa growers.

## 3. Lucerne (Medicago sativa)

### 3.1 Overview

Lucerne, also known as alfalfa, is a perennial fodder crop used primarily for hay. It is reliable but water-intensive and generally produces lower returns per hectare than moringa or dragonfruit.

### 3.2 Key Points

#### Climate and Water
- Thrives on deep, fertile soils with plenty of water
- Needs ≈800 mm of water annually (rain or irrigation) to yield well
- Bela Bela's rainfall is insufficient, so irrigation is mandatory

#### Planting and Harvest
- Sow lucerne in autumn or spring at about 25 kg of seed per hectare
- Stands persist for 4–6 years
- With good management: 4–8 cuts per year
- Production: 15–30 t of hay per hectare

#### Labour and Mechanization
- Mowing, raking, and baling lucerne by hand is arduous
- Efficient production usually requires tractors and balers
- Small farms can cut and dry hay manually but labour demand is high

#### Markets and Income
- Hay sells for ≈R2,200–R3,300 per ton
- Gross income: ~R50,000 per hectare
- Net profit on small non-mechanized plot: Low (≈R20k/ha) once water and fertilizer costs are accounted for
- Best suited if you have livestock to feed or larger land with mechanization

#### Risks
- Drought
- Water scarcity
- Root rot in waterlogged soils
- Price volatility
- Lucerne fields need rotation or renewal after several years to maintain productivity

## 4. Dragonfruit (Hylocereus spp.)

### 4.1 Overview

Dragonfruit, also called pitaya, is a climbing cactus that produces exotic, high-value fruit. It offers large profits per hectare but demands capital investment and patience.

### 4.2 Key Points

#### Climate
- Likes warm days and mild nights
- Sensitive to frost
- Winter temperatures below about 0°C can damage or kill vines
- In Bela Bela, frost events necessitate protective measures (fleece covers or sprinklers at dawn)

#### Infrastructure
- Each plant requires a robust trellis or post (≈1.5–2 m tall) to climb
- Setting up an orchard involves sinking posts, fixing cross-arms or rings, and running irrigation lines
- Density: 1,250–1,500 plants per hectare is common

#### Water and Care
- Dragonfruit is a cactus and tolerates drought better than lucerne
- Yields are higher with regular irrigation during flowering and fruiting
- Vines need pruning and training along the trellis
- Flowers sometimes need hand-pollination at night to ensure good fruit set

#### Time to Yield
- Expect little commercial fruit for the first 18–24 months
- Full production (15–30 t fruit per hectare) begins from year 3 or 4
- Fruit fetches ≈R50–R60 per kilogram locally
- Export prices can be higher

#### Costs and Returns
- Establishing a hectare: R200k–R400k (trellises, cuttings, irrigation)
- Gross revenue at full production: R500k–R1M per hectare
- Small plots of 0.2 ha can still be worthwhile if local markets for the fruit exist

#### Risks
- High setup cost
- Frost damage
- Pests such as fruit bats and birds
- Limited domestic demand
- Marketing is crucial; fruit must be picked ripe and sold quickly

## 5. Diversification and Additional Crops

To spread risk and create year-round income, the plan proposes diversifying beyond moringa, lucerne, and dragonfruit.

### 5.1 Additional Crop Options

#### Pomegranates
- Drought-tolerant fruit tree with light frost tolerance
- Fruits in 3–4 years
- Can share irrigation infrastructure with dragonfruit

#### Vegetables and Tubers
Short-season crops like:
- Butternut
- Sweet potato
- Watermelon
- Can be grown between young trees or on resting fields to generate quick cash

#### Herbs and Medicinal Plants
- **Rosemary and lavender**: Thrive in dry, sunny areas; provide products for culinary and essential-oil markets
- **Turmeric, ginger**: Market potential
- **Devil's claw or aloe vera**: Could be trialed

#### Prickly Pear
- Hardy cactus that yields edible fruit and pads for livestock feed
- Spineless varieties available
- Can double as a living fence

#### Grain and Forage Crops
- Maize
- Teff grass
- Sunflower
- Cowpeas
- Can be rotated with lucerne to improve soil and provide feed or grain sales

### 5.2 Distribution of Effort and Land

For a one-hectare farm, a balanced allocation might be:

| Crop | Area | Percentage | Notes |
|------|------|------------|-------|
| Lucerne | 0.5 ha | 50% | Offers steady fodder income but requires the most water |
| Moringa | 0.3 ha | 30% | High-value crop that uses less water and gives earlier returns |
| Dragonfruit | 0.2 ha | 20% | Requires capital but has long-term profit potential; start small |
| Experiments & infrastructure | 0.1 ha | 10% | Space for nursery, paths, storage and trials of additional crops |

### 5.3 Labour Scheduling

Time and labour should be scheduled to avoid conflicts:

- **Moringa**: ~40% of labour (frequent but light harvests and processing)
- **Lucerne**: ~30% of labour (episodic heavy cutting and baling)
- **Dragonfruit**: ~20% of labour (training vines, hand-pollination and picking)
- **Other tasks**: ~10% of labour (maintenance, marketing, record-keeping)

Reinvest profits where returns are highest, and keep a contingency fund for unforeseen expenses.
