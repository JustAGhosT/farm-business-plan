# Deployment Guide

This document describes the automated deployment workflows and manual deployment options for the Farm Business Plan application.

**üöÄ Live Application:** [https://farmplan.netlify.app/](https://farmplan.netlify.app/)

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Netlify Deployment

The application automatically deploys to Netlify when changes are pushed to the repository.

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/netlify-deploy.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch ‚Üí Production deployment
- Push to `develop` branch ‚Üí Staging deployment
- Pull requests ‚Üí Preview deployment with URL comment

**Setup Requirements:**
1. Create a Netlify account and site
2. **Configure Netlify Build Settings** (Important!):
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your Site ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Build settings
   - Set the following values:
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `out` (NOT `.next` - this is critical!)
     - **Base directory**: (leave empty or set to `/`)
   - Click "Save" to apply changes
   - **Note**: Netlify may auto-detect settings incorrectly for Next.js static export. Always verify!
3. Add GitHub repository secrets:
   - `NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TOKEN`: Your Netlify personal access token
     - Found at: Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí User Settings ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Personal access tokens
     - Create new token with full access permissions
   - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Your Netlify site ID (API ID)
     - Found at: Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your Site ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Site details ‚Üí API ID
     - **Note**: Use the API ID, not the site name

**Features:**
- Automatic dependency caching for faster builds
- Linting validation before deployment
- Build artifact uploads for debugging
- PR preview comments with deployment URL

**Deployment URLs:**
- **Production**: [https://farmplan.netlify.app/](https://farmplan.netlify.app/)
- **Staging**: Automatically deployed from `develop` branch
- **Preview**: Unique URLs generated for each pull request

### Database Deployment

Automated database migrations and deployments.

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/database-deploy.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` with database file changes
- Manual workflow dispatch (for controlled deployments)

**Setup Requirements:**
1. Set up PostgreSQL database (staging and production)
2. Add GitHub repository secrets:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Staging database connection string
   - `DATABASE_URL_PRODUCTION`: Production database connection string

**Features:**
- Schema validation before migration
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Automatic backups before production deployments
- Database health checks after migration
- Optional seeding for staging environment

**Manual Trigger:**
```bash
# Via GitHub UI: Actions ‚Üí Database Deployment ‚Üí Run workflow
# Select environment: staging or production
```

## Manual Deployment

### Static Site Export

Build and deploy the static site manually:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# The output will be in the 'out' directory
# Upload contents to any static hosting provider
```

### Netlify Manual Deploy

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# 1. Create database
createdb farm_business_plan

# 2. Apply schema
psql -U username -d farm_business_plan -f db/schema.sql

# 3. Run migrations (in order)
psql -U username -d farm_business_plan -f db/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql

# 4. Seed data (optional)
psql -U username -d farm_business_plan -f db/seeds/001_crop_templates.sql
```

## Environment Variables

### For Application

```bash
# .env.local (for local development)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/farm_business_plan
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### For GitHub Actions

Required secrets in repository settings:
- `NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TOKEN`
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DATABASE_URL_PRODUCTION`

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Linting passes with no errors
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Database migrations tested in staging
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Secrets added to GitHub repository
- [ ] Netlify site connected to repository
- [ ] **Netlify publish directory set to `out`** (not `.next`)
- [ ] Netlify build command set to `npm run build`
- [ ] Database backup created

## Rollback Procedures

### Application Rollback (Netlify)

1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Navigate to "Deploys"
4. Find the previous working deployment
5. Click "Publish deploy"

### Database Rollback

1. Stop the application
2. Restore from backup:
   ```bash
   psql farm_business_plan < backup_file.sql
   ```
3. Restart the application

## Monitoring

### Application Monitoring

- **Netlify Dashboard**: Build logs, deployment status, analytics
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow run history, artifacts

### Database Monitoring

- Check database health: Run queries on `farm_plan_summary` view
- Monitor connection pool usage
- Check slow query logs

## Troubleshooting

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: If you're seeing "Error: Not Found" from the Netlify GitHub Action, the most common cause is an incorrect publish directory setting in your Netlify dashboard. Jump to ["Error: Not Found" from Netlify Action](#error-not-found-from-netlify-action) for the fix.

### Quick Fix: Common Issues

| Issue | Quick Solution |
|-------|---------------|
| "Error: Not Found" from Netlify Action | ‚úÖ Check Netlify publish directory is set to `out` (not `.next`) |
| Deployment succeeds but site is broken | ‚úÖ Verify `next.config.js` has `output: 'export'` |
| Build fails in GitHub Actions | ‚úÖ Run `npm run build` locally to identify the issue |
| 404 on routes after deployment | ‚úÖ Check redirect rules in `netlify.toml` |

### Build Failures

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify all dependencies are in package.json
3. Ensure Node.js version matches (18.x)
4. Clear cache and rebuild

### Database Migration Failures

1. Check workflow logs for error messages
2. Verify database connection string
3. Test migration locally first
4. Ensure database user has required permissions
5. Check for conflicting schema changes

### Deployment Issues

1. Verify Netlify secrets are set correctly
2. Check build command in netlify.toml
3. Ensure static export is enabled in next.config.js
4. Review Netlify deploy logs

#### "Error: Not Found" from Netlify Action

This error typically indicates an issue with Netlify credentials or site configuration:

1. **Verify Netlify Publish Directory (MOST COMMON ISSUE)**:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **This is the most common cause of "Error: Not Found"**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your Site ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Build settings
   - **Check the "Publish directory" setting**
   - For Next.js static export (which this project uses), it MUST be set to: **`out`**
   - If it shows `.next` or any other directory, this is **wrong** and will cause deployment failures
   - **Fix**: Change "Publish directory" from `.next` to `out`
   - Click "Save" to apply the change
   - **Why**: Next.js with `output: 'export'` generates static HTML files in the `out/` directory, not `.next/`
   - The `.next/` directory contains only build metadata and cannot be served as a website

2. **Verify NETLIFY_SITE_ID**: 
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your Site ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Site details
   - Copy the "API ID" (not the site name)
   - Add/update it in GitHub repository secrets as `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`

3. **Verify NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TOKEN**:
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí User Settings ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token if needed
   - Add/update it in GitHub repository secrets as `NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TOKEN`
   - Ensure the token has full access permissions

4. **Team-Owned Sites (Common Issue)**:
   - If your site is owned by a team (not your personal account), this is a common cause of "Error: Not Found"
   - The personal access token must be from a user who is a **member of the team** that owns the site
   - **Solution**: Go to your Netlify team settings and ensure:
     - You are logged in as a user who has access to the team
     - Generate the token while logged in as that user
     - The token has permissions to deploy to team sites
   - Alternative: Consider transferring the site to your personal account if team ownership isn't required

5. **Check Site Exists**:
   - Confirm the Netlify site hasn't been deleted
   - Verify you have access to the site with your token

6. **Test Token Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Install Netlify CLI
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   
   # Test authentication with your token
   export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   netlify sites:list
   
   # Link to your site (uses NETLIFY_SITE_ID)
   netlify link --id YOUR_SITE_ID
   
   # Test deployment (note: uses 'out' directory)
   netlify deploy --dir=out
   ```
   
   If the CLI commands fail with the same error, the token doesn't have access to the site.
