## ✨ What Was Delivered

### 1. Generic CRUD Hook (`lib/hooks/useCrudApi.ts`)

```typescript
// Before: Each hook was 150-200 lines of duplicated code
// After: Each hook is now 15-75 lines using useCrudApi

// Example usage:
const { items, loading, error, create, update, remove } = useCrudApi<Task>({
  endpoint: '/api/tasks',
  filters: { farm_plan_id: '123' },
  timeout: 30000,
})
```

**Features:**

- Type-safe generic implementation
- Consistent 30s timeout handling
- Filter memoization
- Support for PATCH and PUT methods
- Built-in error handling with AbortController

### 2. Centralized Error Handling (12 API Routes)

```typescript
// Before: 8-12 lines per error
return NextResponse.json(
  { success: false, error: 'Failed...', details: ... },
  { status: 500 }
)

// After: 1 line with better tracking
return createErrorResponse('Failed...', 500, details, 'ERROR_CODE')
```

**Benefits:**

- Consistent error format with requestId
- Standardized error codes
- Timestamps for debugging
- Better error tracking

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite

**File:** `__tests__/lib/hooks/useCrudApi.test.ts`

**14 tests covering:**

- ✅ GET operations (success, filters, errors, timeouts)
- ✅ POST operations (create success/errors)
- ✅ PATCH/PUT operations (both methods)
- ✅ DELETE operations (success/errors)
- ✅ Refetch functionality
- ✅ Error clearing
- ✅ Filter memoization

**All 189 tests passing!**

### 4. Future Enhancements Documentation

**File:** `docs/future-enhancements.md` (600+ lines)

**Includes 13 detailed proposals:**

**High Priority:**

1. Optimistic updates (4-6 hours)
2. Request debouncing (2-3 hours)
3. Client-side caching (6-8 hours)
4. Pagination support (8-10 hours)

**Medium Priority:** 5. Request cancellation 6. Retry logic 7. WebSocket support

**Plus:** Implementation roadmap, code examples, effort estimates

## ⚠️ Note on Pre-Existing Errors

The TypeScript compiler shows 2 errors in `app/tools/calculators/wizard/page.tsx`:

- Lines 148 and 394 (type mismatches)

**These errors existed BEFORE this refactoring** and are NOT related to our changes. Our refactored code has zero TypeScript errors.

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Creating a New CRUD Hook

```typescript
import { useCrudApi } from '@/lib/hooks/useCrudApi'

export function useMyResource(filters?: MyFilters) {
  const { items, loading, error, create, update, remove } = useCrudApi<MyType>({
    endpoint: '/api/my-resource',
    filters,
  })

  return {
    resources: items,
    loading,
    error,
    createResource: create,
    updateResource: update,
    deleteResource: remove,
  }
}
```

### Using Centralized Errors in API Routes

```typescript
import { createErrorResponse } from '@/lib/api-utils'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  try {
    // Your logic
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data: result.rows })
  } catch (error) {
    return createErrorResponse('Failed to fetch', 500)
  }
}
```
