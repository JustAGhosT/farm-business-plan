- **Setup Investment**: Low to moderate (varies by scale)
- **Timeframe**: First harvest 3-8 months

### Example 2: Fodder & Feed Crops
- **Application**: Alfalfa/lucerne, forage grasses, hay production
- **Characteristics**: Steady demand, perennial production, mechanization potential
- **Setup Investment**: Moderate (equipment dependent)
- **Timeframe**: First harvest 3-6 months

### Example 3: High-Value Fruit Crops
- **Application**: Dragon fruit, exotic fruits, premium produce
- **Characteristics**: Long-term investment, premium pricing, unique market position
- **Setup Investment**: High (infrastructure intensive)
- **Timeframe**: Full production 2-4 years

### Example 4: Diversified Systems
- **Application**: Multiple crops, staggered income streams, risk distribution
- **Characteristics**: Balanced portfolio, year-round production, resource optimization
- **Setup Investment**: Variable based on crop selection

## Planning Framework Components

### Location and Climate Assessment
- **Climate Analysis**: Temperature ranges, rainfall patterns, seasonal variations
- **Climate Type**: [Your climate classification - tropical, temperate, arid, etc.]
- **Growing Season**: [Your primary growing season(s)]
- **Frost Risk**: [Assessment of frost frequency and timing]
- **Irrigation**: [Water availability and requirements analysis]

### Land and Soil Considerations
- **Land Size**: [Your available land area]
- **Soil Type**: [Your soil classification and characteristics]
- **Drainage**: [Drainage assessment and requirements]
- **pH Requirements**: [Target pH range for selected crops]
- **Amendments**: [Required soil improvements]

### Crop Selection Framework
Use this template to evaluate and select crops for your operation:

| **Crop Category** | **Your Crop** | **Land Allocation** | **Priority** |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Primary Income Crop(s) | [Crop 1] | [%] | High |
| Secondary Crop(s) | [Crop 2] | [%] | Medium |
| Diversification Crop(s) | [Crop 3] | [%] | Low-Medium |
| Experimental/Nursery | [Space] | [%] | Development |

### Sample Allocation (1 hectare example)
- **Primary Crop**: 0.4-0.5 ha (40-50%) - Main income generator
- **Secondary Crop**: 0.3-0.4 ha (30-40%) - Diversification and risk management
- **Specialty/Premium Crop**: 0.1-0.2 ha (10-20%) - High-value niche market
- **Infrastructure & Trials**: 0.1 ha (10%) - Nursery, storage, experiments
